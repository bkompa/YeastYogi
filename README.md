Program for the [Bloom Lab](http://bloomlab.web.unc.edu/) to analyze dynamic stretching of DNA simulations. Simulations are done in [ChromoShake](http://bloomlab.web.unc.edu/files/2016/01/Mol.-Biol.-Cell-2016-Lawrimore-153-66.pdf). The goal of the project is to see whether extension and contraction rates of simulated DNA without condensin match microscope data of cells that are depleted of condensin.
